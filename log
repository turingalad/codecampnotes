Spend most time figuring out GitHub.
On CodeNewbie Podcast, Saron, the host, referred to these days I'm currently in (figuring out GitHub for the first time) as... I can't remember... but it was negative.

Started on Build Personal Portfolio project. 
One page, scrolling theme. 
Don't even know where to start. 
Searching web inspecting elements is definitely not it. 
Browsing CodePen for other Campers' projects feels like a violation. 
But what's the difference in doing that vs. searching the web for other tutorials and copying (with slight changes, of course) code from another place?
(Other than efficiency, of course.)

Wasted time figuting out GitHub.
(Damnit, neurons--move faster!!)
